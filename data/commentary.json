    "body": "Commonwealth Bank continues to lead the peer group with a cash ROE of 13.5%, down just 10bps from FY24. This reflects CBA's superior pricing power, scale advantages, and the highest net interest margin among the majors. NAB sits second at 11.4%, while Macquarie's diversified model delivered 11.2%. Westpac's 9.7% is suppressed by elevated restructuring costs from its UNITE transformation. ANZ's reported 8.1% was heavily distorted by $1.1bn in significant items including a $585m restructuring charge and $271m ASIC settlement — excluding these, underlying returns were materially closer to peer levels.",

    "body": "CBA's NIM of 2.08% — up 9bps from FY24 — is the clear standout, reflecting higher earnings on capital and portfolio hedges despite intense mortgage competition. Westpac follows at 1.94% (down just 1bp), with its core NIM at 1.81% excluding Treasury & Markets. NAB's margin lifted 3bps to 1.74%, aided by Markets & Treasury income. ANZ's 1.55% reflects the drag from mortgage competition and the Suncorp Bank integration diluting margins. Macquarie's BFS division benefits from market-leading digital deposit growth, though as a diversified group, its NIM is not directly comparable to the pure retail banks.",

    "body": "CBA's cost-to-income of 45.5% remains best in class, even as it hired 2,000+ engineers and boosted annual investment spend by $300m to $2.3bn. NAB reported approximately 47%, reflecting disciplined cost management despite increased digital platform investment. Macquarie's ~48.5% benefits from scalable fee-based revenue streams. Both Westpac (~53%) and ANZ (~53.2%) were materially impacted by large restructuring charges — $273m for Westpac's UNITE program and $585m for ANZ's headcount reduction. Underlying ratios for both are approximately 3-5 percentage points lower and expected to improve in FY26 as cost savings materialise.",

Westpac's 12.5% — up 4bps despite a $581m buyback — provides $3.1bn above its new 11.25% target. CBA is at 12.3%, flat on FY24, while ANZ's 12.0% (pro-forma 12.26% after capital actions) reflects the Suncorp integration period. NAB's 11.7% is the lowest but still comfortably above APRA's 10.25% minimum. The sector's strong capital positions take on added significance as APRA phases out AT1 capital instruments from January 2027, requiring banks to hold more CET1 and Tier 2 capital.",

CBA led across most metrics, reinforcing its position as the sector's premium franchise. Several banks took large one-off charges to position for future efficiency gains through technology transformation and AI adoption."
